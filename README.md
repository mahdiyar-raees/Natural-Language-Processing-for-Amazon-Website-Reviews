# Natural Language Processing for Amazon Website Reviews

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing for Amazon Website Reviews Project, a multifaceted exploration in the world of text analysis and sentiment prediction. This project explore the Natural Language Processing for Amazon Website Reviews Project, a comprehensive journey into text analysis and sentiment prediction. Our project unfolds in three key steps, providing invaluable insights into customer reviews on the Amazon website. Beginning with data analysis and statistical calculations, we gain an overview of overall sentiment and trends. Subsequently, we develop models for feature extraction, generating product insights. Our final step involves sentiment analysis, enabling the prediction of product sentiment based on customer reviews. This project significantly enhances our understanding of customer sentiment at scale.


**Key Highlights:**

- **Data Analysis:** We begin by downloading and analyzing customer reviews, running statistical calculations to gain insight into the overall sentiment and trends within the data.

- **Feature Extraction:** Our project features the development of a model that calculates specific product features based on the reviews given by customers. This valuable information can provide insights for product improvement and marketing strategies.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** The third step involves creating a sentiment analysis model that predicts the sentiment of a product based on customer reviews. This predictive model is a valuable tool for understanding customer sentiment at scale.
